\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Simple ROS-node, that localizes robot and navigates to next target point

This script creates a ROS node, which simulates the robot naviagation. It
implements an action server, that can receive a new target position. The
server simply waits for some time and considers the position to be reached.
Then the positions is published to the topic pet_position.

The programmer has chosen an action server instead of a service, because the
action server does not block the client. This way the client can continue
working while the result of this action is computed.
