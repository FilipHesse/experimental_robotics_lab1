"""Heart of robot_pet package: defines robots behavior

Contains a finite state machine implemented in smach. The 3 states of the
robot pet are NORMAL, PLAY and SLEEP. The state diagram can be found in the
README.md of the project

Each interface with the ROS infrastructure, such as service clients,
servers, action clients and publishers are implemented within separate
classes. All these interfaces are then passed to the smach-states while they
are constructed, in order to make the interfaces accessible for the states.

    Requirements:
        The following parameters need to be set in the ros parameter server:
            /map_width
            /map_height
        You can use the launchfile params.launch to set these to some 
        default values
